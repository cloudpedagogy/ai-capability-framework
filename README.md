## 📘 About the Framework

The AI Capability Framework supports capability development across six interdependent domains:

1. **AI Awareness & Orientation**  
2. **Human–AI Co-Agency**  
3. **Generative Practice & Innovation**  
4. **Ethics, Equity & Impact**  
5. **Decision-Making & Governance**  
6. **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

It offers a structured, future-ready model for responsible, transparent, and creative AI use across:

- Higher education  
- Research and academic writing  
- Public services and government  
- Healthcare and NGOs  
- Digital learning and organisational strategy  

The framework is grounded in **ecological learning**, **design thinking**, and **ethical foresight**, enabling individuals and teams to move beyond tool-focused training toward applied, adaptive, and values-aligned AI capability.
